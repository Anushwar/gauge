## Installation

- If you want to set up the project inside your local environment, you can copy
  the variables from the `.env.example` and create a new `.env` file and paste
  it there.

- To generate the values, visit the [Supabase](https://www.supabase.com)
  Dashboard and create a new project.

- After Creating the project, you can then get the supabase URL and the API key
  for the project from settings.

  > Alternatively, You can Follow along with this video for reference
  > [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOppukfgL_o). You only have to follow
  > through the part of generating the credentials.

- I used Bun to build this project. You can use any package manager of your
  choice:

  ```bash
  bun i
  bun dev
  ```
